      <description>Imagine using an R markdown file to run Python code. Well, I am! The reticulate package includes a Python engine that allows for conversation between R and Python code chunks. The two languages are super similar and have full access to each others objects. Python chunks work exactly like chunks of R code! The code is executed, the output is printed and then included within the document.
Pandas is an extremely useful package in the world of data.</description>

      <description>Like nearly everyone on the planet, I had a New Year’s resolution. I wanted to read more books. I have loved reading for as long as I can remember. Yet, I think the last time I had really read more than the books assigned for school was my sophomore year of high school. I got busy applying for college and getting jobs. It didn’t bother me until I was trapped at home every day.</description>
